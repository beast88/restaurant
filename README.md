# Restaurant Page - Webpack

## Project Overview

### Description

A simple page that could be used by a Restaurant to display their menu and contact details.

Instead of using plain HTML to build the pages, I used webpack and modularisation. All the pages are built using javascript DOM manipulation.

## Development

### Technologies

- Webpack
- Bootstrap
- Responsive Design

### Applied Skills

- DOM manipulation
- Modularisation

### Notes

Using this method to generate a static website is initially counter intuitive. However, it opens up the scope to add multiple 'pages' by using javascript to alter the DOM.
